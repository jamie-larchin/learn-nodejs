Ok, we’ve looked at routes and static assets, which leaves us one more key feature to discuss: templates.

Templates allow us to take a webpage and put placeholders in it for content that will be filled in by the server.  This lets us create one template and use it for multiple pages.  It’s really powerful.  Templating is very common in web apps, but also often used for other purposes too.

There are many many different template systems and Express doesn’t have a built in one.  Instead it lets you add one using a **view engine**.  There are view engines for many different template systems but the one which we are going to use today is called EJS (or Embedded Javascript).

In this step, we are going to install EJS as a view engine for Express and change our TinyCakes home and about pages from static pages to templates.

## Setting up Express to use EJS

First you need to install EJS, which you do with NPM just like you installed Express.  Stop your server running and type the following in the terminal and press enter:

```
npm install ejs -—save
```

Now that EJS is installed, we need to tell express to use EJS as the view engine.  To do that add the following code before your routes:

```javascript
server.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```

Express’s `set()` function sets configuration in the server object.  Here we use it to set the view engine setting to `ejs`.  Now when the server starts it will look for a package called `ejs` and try to use it as a view engine.

## Adding a template

Express expects templates to be found in a folder called views.  So lets create that folder, and another folder within that called pages.  We are going to put our page templates in this folder.

Once you’ve done that move the files `index.html` and `about.html` from `public` to `views/pages`, and rename them to `index.ejs` and `about.ejs`.

## Adding routes that use templates

Since we’ve moved `index.html` and `about.html` from our `public` folder to `views/pages` we have to add routes for them.  Add the following routes:

```javascript

server.get('/', function(request, response) {
  response.render('pages/index');
});


server.get('/about', function(request, response) {
  response.render('pages/about');
});
```

Notice how we added add routes for `/` & `/about` instead of `/index.html` and `/about.html` ?  That’s a fairly common practice because it makes the URLs a little more clearer and simpler, and more related to the nature of the content rather than a specific file.

Notice that we used `response.render()` instead of `response.send()` this time?  Render tells the view system to find the specified template, process it (render it) and send it to the client as the response.  And we didn’t have to include `.ejs` for the template name either.

If you save this and restart the server and go to <http://localhost:3000/> you should see your homepage as before:

[INSERT SCREENSHOT]

You will notice that the link to **About** in the menu doesn’t work because it points to `/about.html` instead of `/about`.  We’ll fix that soon.

So now we are rendering those two pages as templates, but we aren’t really taking advantage of templates yet.  In the next step we’ll start to see some cool stuff we can do with them.
